#YOLO_BASED_ATTENDENCE_SYSTEM_WITH_UNIFOR_COMPILANCE_DETECTION

#This is the project we implemented in our final year of BTECH

#This is a Deep Learning project, using technologies like -
1. Python - For program or scripting
2. Anaconda - to create a virtual environment
3. yolo_v8m - to detect college uniform and id card


#The libraries or dependecies required to be installed in the virtaul environment are
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. os
4. csv
5. datetime
6. cv2
7. face_recognition
8. pickle
9. ultralytics
10. twilio.rest 



|||||| ------ CREATING A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT (open in the working directory)----- ||||||
1. Open Anaconda promt
(type the commands below in anaconda prompt)
2. conda create --name {env_name} python=3.9 (used in this project)
3. conda activate {env_name}
4. conda install numpy pandas (#install all the libraries required)
5. conda activate {env_name}
6. conda deactivate {env_name}



|||||| ------ TRAINING CUSTOM YOLO MODEL AND EXPORTING ------ ||||||
[TRAIN AND EXPORT YOUR MODEL](https://youtu.be/gRAyOPjQ9_s?si=IE9ue3cRdalwzG45)


#You can watch any video on youtube on how to open a twilio accoutn for the SMS implementation
#You will be  given three credentials which you must put in the .env file.

#The Class.csv file should have roll_no, name, phone_no columns

#This details should be enough for now I will update the README file if i remember anything important
